Purpose:

The Namespace Identifier (NID) 'etsi' for Uniform Resource Names
(URNs) will be used to identify resources published by ETSI.  These
might include published standards or protocols that it defines and
which make use of URNs.  These namespaces are globally unique.  The
URN namespace will be used in public networks by clients to configure
and manage resources in the network.  It is the servers that will
enforce the uniqueness of the namespaces by using the namespace and
the XPath associated with the managed node in the network, when
accessing a resource.

Syntax:

   The syntax of namespace specific strings for the 'etsi' namespace
   is <NSS> in Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].

The entire URN is case-insensitive.

Assignment:

   ETSI will maintain the list of registered subtrees that use the
   "etsi" NID at https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/
   ETSIURNNamespace.aspx, in the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry.
   It will describe the <NSS>, how the namespaces will be allocated,
   and how experimental namespaces can be used within the allocated
   URN.

   ETSI will manage resource classes using the "etsi" NID and will be
   the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
   strings.  ETSI will guarantee the uniqueness of the strings
   themselves, by validating it against the existing content of the
   registry.  It may also permit secondary responsibility for certain
   defined resources.  Once a subtree assignment is made, it cannot
   be deleted or reassigned.

   ETSI may allow for use of experimental type values in specific
   subtrees, for testing purposes only.  Note that using experimental
   types may create collision as multiple users may use the same
   values for different resources and specific strings.  All
   experimentation must follow the guidance set forth in A Uniform
   Resource Name (URN) Namespace for Examples [RFC6963].

Interoperability:

There are no known interoperability issues at this time.

Resolution:

   It is not foreseen that URNs within this namespace will undergo
   resolution.
