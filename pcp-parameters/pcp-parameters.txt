   1       UNSUPP_VERSION           The version number at the start of the PCP Request header is not recognized by this PCP server. This  [RFC6887]
                                    is a long lifetime error. [RFC6887] describes PCP version 2.
   2       NOT_AUTHORIZED           The requested operation is disabled for this PCP client, or the PCP client requested an operation     [RFC6887]
                                    that cannot be fulfilled by the PCP server's security policy. This is a long lifetime error.
   3       MALFORMED_REQUEST        The request could not be successfully parsed. This is a long lifetime error.                          [RFC6887]
   4       UNSUPP_OPCODE            Unsupported Opcode. This is a long lifetime error.                                                    [RFC6887]
   5       UNSUPP_OPTION            Unsupported Option. This error only occurs if the Option is in the mandatory-to-process range. This   [RFC6887]
                                    is a long lifetime error.
   6       MALFORMED_OPTION         Malformed Option (e.g., appears too many times, invalid length). This is a long lifetime error.       [RFC6887]
   7       NETWORK_FAILURE          The PCP server or the device it controls are experiencing a network failure of some sort (e.g., has   [RFC6887]
                                    not obtained an External IP address). This is a short lifetime error.
                                    Request is well-formed and valid, but the server has insufficient resources to complete the requested
                                    operation at this time. For example, the NAT device cannot create more mappings at this time, is
   8       NO_RESOURCES             short of CPU cycles or memory, or is unable to handle the request due to some other temporary         [RFC6887]
                                    condition. The same request may succeed in the future. This is a system-wide error, different from
                                    USER_EX_QUOTA. This can be used as a catch- all error, should no other error message be suitable.
                                    This is a short lifetime error.
   9       UNSUPP_PROTOCOL          Unsupported transport protocol, e.g. SCTP in a NAT that handles only UDP and TCP. This is a long      [RFC6887]
                                    lifetime error.
   10      USER_EX_QUOTA            This attempt to create a new mapping would exceed this subscriber's port quota. This is a short       [RFC6887]
                                    lifetime error.
                                    The suggested external port and/or external address cannot be provided. This error MUST only be
                                    returned for: * MAP requests that included the PREFER_FAILURE Option (normal MAP requests will return
   11      CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL  an available external port); * MAP requests for the SCTP protocol (PREFER_FAILURE is implied); * PEER [RFC6887]
                                    requests. See Section 13.2 of [RFC6887] for processing details. The error lifetime depends on the
                                    reason for the failure.
                                    The source IP address of the request packet does not match the contents of the PCP Client's IP
   12      ADDRESS_MISMATCH         Address field, due to an unexpected NAT on the path between the PCP client and the PCP-controlled NAT [RFC6887]
                                    or firewall. This is a long lifetime error.
                                    The PCP server was not able to create the filters in this request. This result code MUST only be
   13      EXCESSIVE_REMOTE_PEERS   returned if the MAP request contained the FILTER Option. See Section 13.3 for processing information. [RFC6887]
                                    This is a long lifetime error.
