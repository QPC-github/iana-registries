                          code is suggested as files of this type are
                          typically used for diagnostic purposes and
                          suitable for analysis in a text editor.  A
                          uniform type identifier (UTI) of "public.utf8-
                          email-message-header" is suggested.  This type
                          conforms to "public.plain-text".

(While the 7bit restriction applies to the message/disposition-
notification portion of the multipart/report content, it does not
apply to the optional third portion of the multipart/report content.)

The message/disposition-notification report type for use in the
multipart/report is "disposition-notification".

The body of a message/disposition-notification consists of one or
more "fields" formatted according to the ABNF of RFC-MSGFMT [RFC5322]
header "fields".  The syntax of the message/disposition-notification
content is as follows:

disposition-notification-content = [ reporting-ua-field CRLF ]
             [ mdn-gateway-field CRLF ]
             [ original-recipient-field CRLF ]
             final-recipient-field CRLF
             [ original-message-id-field CRLF ]
             disposition-field CRLF
             *( error-field CRLF )
             *( extension-field CRLF )

extension-field = extension-field-name ":" *([FWS] text)

extension-field-name = field-name

Note that the order of the above fields is recommended, but not

fixed.  Extension fields can appear anywhere.
