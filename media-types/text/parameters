Type name:  text

Subtype name:  parameters

Required parameters:

Optional parameters:  charset: The charset parameter is applicable to
   the encoding of the parameter values.  The default charset is
   UTF-8, if the 'charset' parameter is not present.

Encoding considerations:  8bit

Security considerations:  This format may carry any type of
   parameters.  Some can have security requirements, like privacy,
   confidentiality or integrity requirements.  The format has no
   built in security protection.  For the usage it was defined the
   transport can be protected between server and client using TLS.
   However, care must be taken to consider if also the proxies are
   trusted with the parameters in case hop-by-hop security is used.
   If stored as a file in file system, the necessary precautions need
   to be taken in relation to the parameters requirements including
   object security such as S/MIME [RFC5751].

Interoperability considerations:  This media type was mentioned as a
   fictional example in [RFC2326], but was not formally specified.
   This has resulted in usage of this media type which may not match
   its formal definition.

Published specification:  RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis-40, Appendix F.

Applications that use this media type:  Applications that use RTSP
   and have additional parameters they like to read and set using the
   RTSP GET_PARAMETER and SET_PARAMETER methods.
