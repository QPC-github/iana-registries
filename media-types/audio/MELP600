Type names:

   audio

Subtype name:

   MELP, MELP2400, MELP1200, and MELP600

Required parameters:

   N/A

Optional parameters:

   ptime:  the recommended length of time (in milliseconds)
      represented by the media in a packet.  It SHALL use the nearest
      rounded-up ms integer packet duration.  For MELPe, this
      corresponds to the values: 23, 45, 68, 90, 112, 135, 156, and
      180.  Larger values can be used as long as they are properly
      rounded.  See Section 6 of RFC 4566 [RFC4566].

   maxptime:  the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can
      be encapsulated in a packet.  It SHALL use the nearest rounded-
      up ms integer packet duration.  For MELPe, this corresponds to
      the values: 23, 45, 68, 90, 112, 135, 156, and 180.  Larger
      values can be used as long as they are properly rounded.  See
      Section 6 of RFC 4566 [RFC4566].

   bitrate:  specifies the MELPe coder bit rates supported.
      Possible values are a comma-separated list of rates from the
      set: 2400, 1200, 600.  The modes are listed in order of
      preference; first is preferred.  If "bitrate" is not present,
      the fixed coder bit rate of 2400 MUST be used.  The alternate
      encoding names, "MELP2400", "MELP1200", and "MELP600" directly
      specify the MELPe coder bit rate of 2400, 1200, and 600
      respectively and MUST NOT specify a "bitrate" parameter.

Encoding considerations:

   This media type is framed and binary, see section 4.8 in RFC6838
   [RFC6838].

Security considerations:

   Please see the security considerations in section 8 of RFC-ietf-payload-melpe-06.

Interoperability considerations:

   Early implementations used MELP2400, MELP1200, and MELP600 to
   indicate both coder type and bit rate.  These media type names
   should be preserved with this registration.

Intended usage:

   COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

   This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
   for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other framing
   protocols is not defined at this time.
