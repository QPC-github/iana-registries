Type name: application

Subtype name: sensml+json

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using a subset of the
encoding allowed in [RFC8259].  See RFC-ietf-core-senml-16 for details.  This
simplifies implementation of very simple system and does not impose
any significant limitations as all this data is meant for machine to
machine communications and is not meant to be human readable.

Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC-ietf-core-senml-16.

Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any JSON
key value pairs that they do not understand unless the key ends with
the '_' character in which case an error MUST be generated.  This
allows backwards compatible extensions to this specification.  The
"bver" field can be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal
level of functionality needed by the creator of the JSON object.

Published specification: RFC-ietf-core-senml-16

Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
that report e.g., electrical power usage and environmental
information such as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a
wide range of sensor reporting systems.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
application/sensml+json is supported by using fragment identifiers as
specified by RFC-ietf-core-senml-16.
