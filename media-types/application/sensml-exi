Type name: application

Subtype name: sensml-exi

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using
[W3C.REC-exi-20140211].  See RFC-ietf-core-senml-16 for details.

Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC-ietf-core-senml-16.

Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any XML
tags or attributes that they do not understand unless the attribute
name ends with the '_' character in which case an error MUST be
generated.  This allows backwards compatible extensions to this
specification.  The "bver" attribute in the senml XML tag can be used
to ensure the receiver supports a minimal level of functionality
needed by the creator of the XML SenML Pack.  Further information on
using schemas to guide the EXI can be found in RFC-ietf-core-senml-16.

Published specification: RFC-ietf-core-senml-16

Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
that report e.g., electrical power usage and environmental
information such as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a
wide range of sensor reporting systems.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
application/sensml-exi is supported by using fragment identifiers as
specified by RFC-ietf-core-senml-16.
