MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: vnd.afpc.modca-overlay

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary (framed transport)

   Being an object inside of the AFP MO:DCA specification, an overlay
   carries text, image, bar code, and graphics data objects, 
   therefore the data is a mixture of binary data and character data.
   The recommended content-transfer-encoding is "base64".

Security considerations: Overlays are part of MO:DCA, which is an 
   architected specification of final-form presentation data. It is 
   not a programming language, does not contain any file operators, 
   and therefore cannot corrupt a receiver's file system or 
   programming environment. It does not allow executable content or 
   calls to external applications.

   The format does not provide integrity or privacy protection in 
   itself. Integrity on file level could be ensured by means external
   to the specification.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: As part of "MO:DCA Reference (Mixed Object 
   Document Content Architecture Reference)", AFP Consortium 
   publication AFPC-0004-09.

Application usage: An overlay is a MO:DCA resource object. An overlay
   is similar to a page in that it defines its own environment and 
   carries the same data objects.

   Used in Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) generators and 
   consumers. A wide variety of applications are created by members 
   of the AFP Consortium and other parties.

Fragment Identifier Considerations: N/A

Restrictions in Usage: This format is mostly used in applications 
   around high speed transactional printing.
