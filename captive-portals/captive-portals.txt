          Key          Type                                           Description                                                 Reference
                              Indicates whether the client is in a state of captivity, i.e it has not satisfied the
   captive            boolean conditions to access the external network. If the client is captive (i.e. captive=true), it [RFC-ietf-capport-api-08]
                              will still be allowed enough access for it to perform server authentication
                              [RFC-ietf-capport-api-08, Section 4.1].
   user-portal-url    string  Provides the URL of a web portal that MUST be accessed over TLS with which a user can       [RFC-ietf-capport-api-08]
                              interact.
                              Provides the URL of a webpage or site that SHOULD be accessed over TLS on which the
   venue-info-url     string  operator of the network has information that it wishes to share with the user (e.g., store  [RFC-ietf-capport-api-08]
                              info, maps, flight status, or entertainment).
                              Indicates that the URL specified as "user-portal-url" allows the user to extend a session
   can-extend-session boolean once the client is no longer in a state of captivity. This provides a hint that a client    [RFC-ietf-capport-api-08]
                              system can suggest accessing the portal URL to the user when the session is near its limit
                              in terms of time or bytes.
                              An integer that indicates the number of seconds remaining, after which the client will be
   seconds-remaining  number  placed into a captive state. The API server SHOULD include this value if the client is not  [RFC-ietf-capport-api-08]
                              captive (i.e. captive=false) and the client session is time-limited, and SHOULD omit this
                              value for captive clients (i.e. captive=true) or when the session is not time-limited.
                              An integer that indicates the number of bytes remaining, after which the client will be in
                              placed into a captive state. The byte count represents the sum of the total number of IP
                              packet (layer 3) bytes sent and received by the client, including IP headers. Captive
   bytes-remaining    number  portal systems might not count traffic to whitelisted servers, such as the API server, but  [RFC-ietf-capport-api-08]
                              clients cannot rely on such behavior. The API server SHOULD include this value if the
                              client is not captive (i.e. captive=false) and the client session is byte-limited, and
                              SHOULD omit this value for captive clients (i.e. captive=true) or when the session is not
                              byte-limited.
