               The resulting string is not a valid label. This disposition may be
     invalid   assigned implicitly, see Section 7.5 of                                  IESG                      [RFC-ietf-lager-specification-13]
               [RFC-ietf-lager-specification-13]. No variant labels should be generated
               from a variant mapping with this type.
               The resulting string is a valid label, but should be blocked from
     blocked   registration. This would typically apply for a derived variant that is   IESG                      [RFC-ietf-lager-specification-13]
               undesirable due to having no practical use or being confusingly similar
               to some other label.
   allocatable The resulting string should be reserved for use by the same operator of  IESG                      [RFC-ietf-lager-specification-13]
               the origin string, but not automatically allocated for use.
    activated  The resulting string should be activated for use. (This is the same as a IESG                      [RFC-ietf-lager-specification-13]
               preferred variant in [RFC3743].)
      valid    The resultant string is a valid label. (This is the typical default      IESG                      [RFC-ietf-lager-specification-13]
               action if no dispositions are defined.)
