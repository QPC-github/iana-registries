          Result Type                                              Description                                                  Reference
   starttls-not-supported    This indicates that the recipient MX did not support STARTTLS.                           [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             This indicates that the certificate presented did not adhere to the constraints
   certificate-host-mismatch specified in the MTA-STS or DANE policy, e.g., if the MX hostname does not match any     [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             identities listed in the subject alternative name (SAN) [RFC5280].
   certificate-expired       This indicates that the certificate has expired.                                         [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
   tlsa-invalid              This indicates a validation error in the TLSA record associated with a DANE policy. None [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             of the records in the RRset were found to be valid.
   dnssec-invalid            This indicates that no valid records were returned from the recursive resolver.          [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             This indicates that the sending system is configured to require DANE TLSA records for
                             all the MX hosts of the destination domain, but no DNSSEC-validated TLSA records were
   dane-required             present for the MX host that is the subject of the report. Mandatory DANE for SMTP is    [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             described in Section 6 of [RFC7672]. Such policies may be created by mutual agreement
                             between two organizations that frequently exchange sensitive content via email.
                             This is a label that covers multiple certificate-related failures that include, but are
                             not limited to, errors such as untrusted/unknown certification authorities (CAs),
   certificate-not-trusted   certificate name constraints, certificate chain errors, etc. When using this             [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             declaration, the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize the "failure-reason-code" to provide more
                             information to the receiving entity.
   sts-policy-invalid        This indicates a validation error for the overall MTA-STS Policy.                        [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
   sts-webpki-invalid        This indicates that the MTA-STS Policy could not be authenticated using PKIX validation. [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             This indicates a general failure for a reason not matching a category above. When using
   validation-failure        this declaration, the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize the "failure-reason-code" to provide  [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             more information to the receiving entity.
   sts-policy-fetch-error    This indicates a failure to retrieve an MTA-STS policy, for example, because the policy  [RFC-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23]
                             host is unreachable.
