IDNA Tables for Unicode version 7.0.0
=====================================

The IDNA tables posted in this directory have been withdrawn due to issues
under consideration within the IETF concerning a new code point introduced
in this version. The IAB has recommended IANA not publish tables derived
from Unicode 7.0.0 at this time.

Please note that the IDNA tables published here are not considered normative.
They are derived from rules described in RFC 5892 that can be applied to new
versions of the Unicode standard.
