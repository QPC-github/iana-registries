Description:
MultiMarkdown (MMD) is a superset of "Original". It adds multiple
syntax features (tables, footnotes, and citations, to name a few),
and is intended to output to various formats. Additionally, it builds
in "smart" typography for various languages (proper left- and right-
sided quotes, for example).

Additional Parameters:

          tokens:

             "memoir" / "beamer"
             "full" / "snippet"
             "process-html"
             "random-footnote-identifiers"
             "accept"
             "reject"
             "nosmart"
             "nonotes"
             "nolabels"
             "nomask"

          The meanings of these tokens are defined in the
          MultiMarkdown documentation.
