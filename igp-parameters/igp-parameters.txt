   Value                                         Description                                                            Reference
         Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. This is the standard shortest path
   0     algorithm as computed by the IGP protocol. Consistent with the deployed practice for         [RFC-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions-24]
         link-state protocols, Algorithm 0 permits any node to overwrite the SPF path with a
         different path based on its local policy.
         Strict Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. The algorithm is identical
   1     to Algorithm 0 but Algorithm 1 requires that all nodes along the path will honor the SPF     [RFC-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions-24]
         routing decision. Local policy at the node claiming support for Algorithm 1 MUST NOT alter
         the SPF paths computed by Algorithm 1.
